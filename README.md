# **Data Integrity Checker**

### **The Skill: Software QA & Data Management**

**Why I built this:**
In my work experience, I have seen firsthand how a single manual entry error could snowball into major delays. I wanted to create a tool that catches those mistakes before they cause problems. This project is a direct reflection of data accuracy.

**How it works:**
I’ve included two parts to show how I handle data at different levels:

**The Backend (Python):** I wrote a script (`data_check.py`) that acts as a "filter" to scan through raw data and log errors instantly.

**The Frontend (HTML):** I built a simple, live interface (`integrity-demo.html`) so non-technical users can run their own audits and see results visually.


**The Real-World Impact:**
This isn't just code,it’s about **efficiency**. By automating the "integrity check," I’m replicating the same workflow that helped me cut result delivery times by 60% in a high-pressure lab environment.

**Try it out:**

1. **For the logic:** Run `python data_check.py` to see the error-flagging in action.
2. **For the experience:** Open `integrity-demo.html` in your browser to use the interactive audit tool.
